                </h1>
                <p class="quote">I used to want to save the world. To end war and bring peace to mankind. But then, I
                    glimpsed the
                    darkness
                    that lives within their light. I learned that inside every one of them, there will always be both.
                    The
                    choice each must make for themselves - something no hero will ever defeat. I've touched the darkness
                    that
                    lives in between the light. Seen the worst of this world, and the best. Seen the terrible things men
                    do to
                    each other in the name of hatred, and the lengths they'll go to for love. Now I know. Only love can
                    save
                    this world. So I stay. I fight, and I give... for the world I know can be. This is my mission, now.
                    Forever.
